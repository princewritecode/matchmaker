bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-folder>
2. Install dependencies
bash
npm install
3. Set up MongoDB
Make sure you have MongoDB running locally or provide a MongoDB URI in config/database.js.

4. Start the server
bash
node index.js
Server runs on http://localhost:3000.

Notes
All endpoints expect and return JSON.

Error handling is basic; for production, consider improving validation and error responses.

The user model (model/user.js) and database connection (config/database.js) should be implemented as per your database schema and connection details.
